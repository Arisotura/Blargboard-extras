# Remove Blargbox
This removes the Blargbox (or the PoRA if you speak awesome). Very basic change to the default template that really didn't need to be made.

Template modification created by Deltier / Tierage.

## Installation
Go to your boards templates directory. Replace the current pagelayout.tpl with the Remove Blargbox one. You're done.

Keep in mind that if there are any other modifications to the current pagelayout.tpl, it may explode in your face.

Also, once it's in use, you can still edit the Blargbox's text in the admin panel. Just ignore that, it won't do anything.
