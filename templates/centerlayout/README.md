# Centered Layout
This removes the header info box and the sidebar. It also centers the header's banner. Basically, you turn your board into Blargboard Plus with the change of one file, so magic.

Template modification created by Deltier / Tierage.

## Installation
Go to your boards templates directory. Replace the current pagelayout.tpl with the Centered Layout one. You're done.

Keep in mind that if there are any other modifications to the current pagelayout.tpl, it may explode in your face.

Also, once it's in use, you can still edit the Blargbox's text in the admin panel. Just ignore that, it won't do anything.
