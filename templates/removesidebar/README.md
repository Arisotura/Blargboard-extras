# Remove Sidebar
This removes the sidebar from the board. Very basic change to the default template that really didn't need to be made. Also gives a bit of an RVLution look to it.

Template modification created by Deltier / Tierage.

## Installation
Go to your boards templates directory. Replace the current pagelayout.tpl with the Remove Sidebar one. You're done.

Keep in mind that if there are any other modifications to the current pagelayout.tpl, it may explode in your face.
